# Java 11 to Java 22 Upgrade Project Summary

## Project Goals

Safely upgrade a legacy Java 11 Spring Boot e-commerce API to Java 22 while maintaining:

   * 100% API compatibility - Same request/response formats, no breaking changes for clients
   * All existing functionality - Core business logic must remain unchanged
   * Complete test coverage - All 138 unit tests must continue passing
   * Security improvements - Remove vulnerable dependencies during upgrade

## Current Project State

### Technology Stack

   * Current Java: 11 → Target: 22
   * Spring Boot: 2.7.18 (will upgrade to 3.2.x)
   * Database: H2 in-memory
   * Testing: JUnit 4 + Mockito (138 tests)
   * Build: Maven
   * Architecture: Traditional layered (Controller → Service → Repository → Model)

### ✅ Phase 1 COMPLETED: Pre-Upgrade Stabilization

Status: All objectives achieved

#### What Was Accomplished:

   1. Fixed all test failures - ProductControllerTest.testCreateProduct_InvalidInput was failing due to Bean Validation vs service-level validation mismatch
   2. Security updates completed:
      * Commons Collections: 3.2.2 (vulnerable, 2006) → 4.4 (secure)
      3. Commons Lang3: 3.12.0 → 3.14.0 (latest Java 11 compatible)
   4. Established clean baseline - All 138 tests passing consistently
   5. Created comprehensive upgrade strategy - Multi-phase approach documented in progress.md

#### Test Coverage Status:

   * Total Tests: 138 (100% passing)
   * Test Types: Controller tests (MockMvc), Service tests (Mockito), Model tests (JUnit 4)
   * Key Test Files:
      * ProductControllerTest (25 tests)
      * OrderControllerTest (comprehensive API coverage)
      * UserServiceTest, ProductServiceTest, OrderServiceTest
      * Model tests: OrderTest, OrderItemTest

## Next Steps: Phase 2 - Java 17 Upgrade (Most Critical Phase)

### 🎯 Phase 2 Objectives

This is the most complex phase involving major breaking changes:

#### 2.1 Java Runtime Upgrade

   * [ ] Update java.version from 11 → 17 in pom.xml
   * [ ] Update Maven compiler source/target to 17
   * [ ] Test application startup and basic functionality

#### 2.2 Spring Boot Major Version Upgrade ⚠️ HIGH RISK

   * [ ] Upgrade Spring Boot 2.7.18 → 3.1.x (requires Java 17+)
   * [ ] Critical: Handle javax → jakarta namespace migration across entire codebase
   * [ ] Update JPA imports: javax.persistence.* → jakarta.persistence.*
   * [ ] Update Servlet API references: javax.servlet.* → jakarta.servlet.*
   * [ ] Update Bean Validation: javax.validation.* → jakarta.validation.*

#### 2.3 Testing Framework Compatibility

   * [ ] Keep JUnit 4 (business requirement to maintain legacy feel)
   * [ ] Update Mockito to Java 17 compatible version
   * [ ] Update Maven Surefire plugin for Java 17 compatibility

#### 2.4 Validation Phase

   * [ ] Critical: Ensure all 138 tests still pass
   * [ ] Verify API contract compatibility (same JSON responses)
   * [ ] Test H2 database functionality
   * [ ] Performance baseline comparison

### Known Challenges for Phase 2

   1. ASM Version Issues: Already seeing warnings about Spring ASM not supporting newer Java versions
   2. Namespace Migration: Large-scale find/replace across codebase (javax → jakarta)
   3. Spring Boot 2→3 Breaking Changes: Configuration property changes, deprecated API removals
   4. Potential Test Breakage: MockMvc behavior changes, validation framework updates

### Files Requiring Updates in Phase 2

   * pom.xml - Java version, Spring Boot version, dependency versions
   * All model classes with @Entity, @Column annotations
   * All controllers with @RestController, validation annotations
   * Service classes using @Transactional
   * Test classes using JPA/servlet imports

### Success Criteria for Phase 2

   * [ ] Application starts successfully on Java 17
   * [ ] All 138 tests pass without modification
   * [ ] All REST endpoints return identical JSON responses
   * [ ] No performance degradation >10%
   * [ ] H2 database operations function identically

### Branch/Commit State

   * Current Branch: upgrade
   * Last Commit: e67aafc - "Phase 1: Pre-upgrade stabilization complete"
   * Clean State: All changes committed, ready for Phase 2

### Important Context

   * The project uses traditional Java patterns (not modern Spring Boot conventions)
   * Bean Validation is active and working differently than service-level validation
   * Constructor injection is used consistently
   * JUnit 4 style must be maintained (business requirement)

## Command to Resume Work

    git checkout upgrade
    mvn clean test  # Should show 138 tests passing
    # Ready to begin Phase 2 Java 17 upgrade

The project is in an excellent state to begin the most challenging phase. The foundation is solid, all tests pass, and security issues are resolved.

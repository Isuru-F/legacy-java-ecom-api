# Java 22 Upgrade Specification
## Legacy E-commerce API Migration Plan

### Overview
This specification outlines a phased approach to upgrade the legacy e-commerce API from Java 11 to Java 22, ensuring zero breaking changes to client APIs and maintaining backward compatibility throughout the process.

### Pre-Upgrade Requirements
- Comprehensive API contract testing suite
- Baseline performance metrics
- Full integration test coverage
- Client API compatibility validation framework
- Minimum 80% test coverage across all modules
- Code coverage reporting tools installed and operational

### Progress Tracking Instructions
Throughout this upgrade process:
1. **Update this spec file** after completing each major task by marking tasks as `[COMPLETED]`
2. **Document any deviations** from the plan with `[DEVIATION: reason]` notes
3. **Record blocker resolutions** directly in the relevant sections
4. **Update progress.md** with detailed status after each phase
5. **Update AGENT.md** with new commands/processes discovered during upgrade

This allows continuation from any point if new threads are started during the process.

- Run `mvn test` to ensure all tests pass
- Run `mvn jacoco:report` to verify coverage thresholds
- Capture all endpoint responses with identical inputs
- Document response times and memory usage
- Test error handling scenarios
- Validate HTTP status codes and headers

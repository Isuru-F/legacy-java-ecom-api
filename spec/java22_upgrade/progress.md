## Phase Timeline
- **Started**: Not yet started
- **Estimated Duration**: 4-6 weeks total
- **Current Phase Start**: N/A
- **Blockers**: None yet

## Notes
- First execution should validate current project state
- All phases require 100% test pass rate before proceeding
- Coverage must be 80%+ before moving to Java version upgrades

# Java 11 to Java 22 Upgrade Progress

## Project Overview
- **Current Java Version**: 11
- **Target Java Version**: 22
- **Current Spring Boot**: 2.7.18
- **Framework**: Spring Boot with JPA, H2 Database
- **Test Framework**: JUnit 4 with Mockito
- **Build Tool**: Maven

## Current State Analysis ✅

### Dependencies Analyzed
- Spring Boot 2.7.18 (Java 11 compatible)
- H2 Database (runtime)
- Commons Lang3 3.12.0
- Commons Collections 3.2.2 (very old, security concerns)
- Jackson libraries (managed by Spring Boot)
- JUnit 4.13.2 + Mockito 3.12.4
- Maven plugins: compiler 3.8.1, surefire 2.22.2, jacoco 0.8.8

### Test Coverage Status
- **Total Tests**: 138 tests
- **Current Status**: 137 passing, 1 failing
- **Failing Test**: `ProductControllerTest.testCreateProduct_InvalidInput`
- **Test Types**: Controller, Service, Model unit tests

### Critical Observations
1. **ASM Version Compatibility Issue**: Already seeing warnings about class file version 67 (Java 23) incompatibility with current Spring ASM version
2. **Legacy Dependencies**: Commons Collections 3.2.2 is very old (2006) and has known security vulnerabilities  
3. **javax vs jakarta**: Currently using `javax.persistence` - will need migration to `jakarta.persistence`

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### 1. API Compatibility Guarantee 🛡️
- **Strategy**: Comprehensive integration tests before any changes
- **Implementation**: Create tests that validate exact JSON responses
- **Validation**: Automated API contract testing in CI/CD

### 2. Database Compatibility 💾
- **Current**: H2 in-memory database
- **Risk**: Schema or JPA behavior changes
- **Mitigation**: H2 compatibility mode testing, JPA validation

### 3. Dependency Hell 📦
- **Risk**: Incompatible dependency combinations
- **Mitigation**: Gradual upgrades, dependency convergence analysis
- **Rollback**: Version-controlled dependency matrix

### 4. Test Stability 🧪
- **Current**: 138 tests (137 passing)
- **Strategy**: Fix all tests before any Java version changes
- **Goal**: Maintain 100% test pass rate throughout upgrade

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements ✅
- [ ] All existing API endpoints continue to work exactly as before
- [ ] Same request/response formats maintained
- [ ] Database operations remain unchanged
- [ ] All business logic preserved

### Non-Functional Requirements 📊
- [ ] Application startup time: ≤ current + 10%
- [ ] Memory usage: ≤ current + 15%
